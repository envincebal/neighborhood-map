## Project Overview
This is a single page application neighborhood map using Google Maps API and Wikipedia API. Knockout.js (MVVM) was implemented to automatically update the view as the user interacts with it. It centers around downtown Portland, OR and features popular locations around the city. The user can click on each marker and see additional information about the location. This application also features a search input to filter out the available locations.
